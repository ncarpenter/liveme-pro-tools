### Getting Support or Assistance

We now have a new forum set up [here](https://livemeprotools.freeflarum.com) where things can be discussed.

**Please note that the LiveMe platform itself is riddled with bugs and errors and this project has demonstrated those errors on many occasions so be prepared for no answers if you have issues.**

### What Is LiveMe Pro Tools?
Its an [Electron](https://electronjs.org) based application for Live.me Social Video network for:
- Search and browse user accounts
- View public replays for user accounts
- See and navigate user's followers and followings
- Watch and download replays
- Allows downloading of replays using internal downloader or FFMPEG
- FFMPEG Hardware-Accelerated video transcoding supported on Linux only!  
  - Fully supports VAAPI on AMD and Intel cards for now.

### Building LiveMe Pro Tools

**Instructions can be found in the DOCS folder on building the various branches of this project.**

### Prebuilt Releases (64-bit only!)

To download the latest prebuilt versions, [click here](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-pro-tools/releases/latest).

**Current Supported Platforms (64-bit only):**
- Ubuntu-based Linux and Debian Distributions (64-bit)
- macOS v10.11 or higher (64-bit only!)
- Windows 7 or higher (64-bit!)

### 32-bit versions???
**Since we've moved to using newer technologies, keeping support for 32-bit versions has been harder to maintain now so we dropped building them January 1st, 2019.**

You are more than welcome to download the source and build your own 32-bit version, but support for issues will be limited.

* * *

### FFMPEG No Longer Required?
You can choose to use a basic built-in concat system now to join the chunks downloaded without needing to have FFMPEG installed on your computer.  Or for better support, you can still use FFMPEG settings.

If you wish to transcode the downloads, then you will need to have FFMPEG installed on your computer.
